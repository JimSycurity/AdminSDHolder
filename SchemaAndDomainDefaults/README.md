# Schema and Domain Defaults

This folder contains data captured from both Microsoft documentation and freshly installed domain controllers in my home lab.

AdminSDHolderDefaults contains both the SDDL and a graphical representation of the SDDL for the various default security descriptors for AdminSDHolder.

Each additional folder contains data on a specific object class, showing the defaultSecurityDescriptor in the schema in graphical format along with the schema definitions.
